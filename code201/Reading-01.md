### Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers ####

    A Poem

    The computer, magnificent it its power.
    Special in the ability to connect the world.
    Uniques languages and protocols translate computer speak
    But I wont tell too much or I could sound like a geek.

    It all starts with a request from the clients browser
    From there the journey contiues long and far
    Once to the destination the trip turns back around
    On the way and soon many files will be found

    A match made in heaven, computer, internet and servers
    Too good to be true at one time but now for all to enjoy
    Posibilities endless and subject to much folklore
    Its now obvious that it wasnt just Al Gore
       
#### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser - Explanation provided by https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/  ####

- The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any link-element references to external CSS stylesheets and any script-element references to scripts.
- As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from link elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from script elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.
- The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.
- As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.
