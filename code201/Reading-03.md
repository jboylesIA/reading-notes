# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model #

## HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model, more inportant bulding blocks to making a a site that is cross functional, user interactive and feature rich. ##

## Learn HTML ##

#### Ordered and Unordered lists ####

- When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
    - When order is not criticale to code or how the content is displayed.  They are usually realted items.

- How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
    - list-style-type: 

- When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML 
document?
    - When specific order is important.

- Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
    - list-style-type: upper-roman; list-style-position: inside;

#### The Box Model  ####

- Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

    - In Box model land there is different areas that make up different spaces and each space has a responsible person. Margin is a guy way on the outside and he looks after all the space that surrounds Box Model land. His ares is exposed to the edges of the land on one side and met by Mrs. Border, she dosent say much but helps others know the lay of the land.  Moving on is a team of workers that place fluffy blankes around the inside of the border and around the content which is where the rubber meets the road.  Think of the padding team as careful packers that allow for movement and shifting.  Then the content kissed a toad, the end!

- List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

    - Content, Padding, Border and Margin

## Learn JS ##

#### Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops. ####

- What data types can you store inside of an Array?
    - numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects or more arrays.

- Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
    - I need more explanation on this one.

- List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
    - Assignment (=)
        - The simple assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. The assignment operation evaluates to the assigned value. Chaining the assignment operator is possible in order to assign a single value to multiple variables. From MDN.

    -    Right shift assignment (>>=)
        - The right shift assignment operator (>>=) moves the specified amount of bits to the right and assigns the result to the variable. From MDN.
    
    - Addition assignment (+=)
        - The addition assignment operator (+=) adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. The types of the two operands determine the behavior of the addition assignment operator. Addition or concatenation is possible. From MDN.

    - Bitwise AND assignment (&=)
        - The bitwise AND assignment operator (&=) uses the binary representation of both operands, does a bitwise AND operation on them and assigns the result to the variable.

    - Logical AND assignment (&&=)
        - The logical AND assignment (x &&= y) operator only assigns if x is truthy.

- Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
        - Again I need more explanation on this.

- Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
        - Password entry.

- Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript
    - When you need to do something repeaditly.
